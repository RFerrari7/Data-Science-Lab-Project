# Data Science Lab project

This repository contains a project developed as part of *Data Science Lab* course of the [Master's degree in Data Science](https://www.unimib.it/graduate/data-science),
University of Milano Bicocca.

## Description

This project aims at analyzing and forecasting daily revenue and the daily number of receipts across six distinct restaurants. By employing a statistical approach and utilizing predictive models, particularly the SARIMA and TBATS models, the focuse is on analyzing historical data related to daily revenue and the number of receipts in each restaurant and formulating future forecasts. Finally, the results of the two models are compared to potentially identify the better-performing one.
